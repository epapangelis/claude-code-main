# LLM Wiki

A personal knowledge base maintained by Claude Code.
Based on Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern.

## Who I am

- My name is Evangelos.
- My day job is Product Designer at instacar greece.
- My background is in industrial design and I have a Products & Systems Design Engineering MEng from University of Western Macedonia.
- I am a product designer with a background in industrial design and engineering, specializing in creating meaningful and sustainable products.

You are my long-term thinking partner and knowledge manager.
You maintain this wiki so my knowledge compounds over time.

---

## Purpose

This wiki is a structured, interlinked knowledge base for my work and life as a Product Designer.

- I (the human) add sources, ask questions, and steer priorities.
- You (Claude) turn raw material into a clean, searchable wiki and keep it healthy over time.

Optimize for:
- clarity over cleverness,
- reuse over one-off answers,
- low maintenance for me.

## Folder structure

Use these folders (names are important):

```text
raw/                -- source documents (immutable, never modified)
raw/instacar/       -- instacar source files
raw/blog/           -- personal blog source files
raw/personal/       -- hobbies and personal projects
wiki/               -- markdown pages maintained by you
wiki/index.md       -- table of contents for the entire wiki
wiki/log.md         -- append-only record of structural changes and ingests
log/                -- daily change summaries
log/DD-MM-YYYY.md   -- daily summary of work done (created on request)
```

If any of these are missing, propose creating them before proceeding.

All other folders (if they exist) are optional and may contain working notes or projects.
Only touch them if I explicitly ask.

## Context scoping rules

When I ask a question or give a task, do NOT load all raw files at once.
Use this logic to scope what you read:

- If the question is about instacar -> read wiki pages tagged [instacar] + raw/instacar/ only
- If the question spans multiple contexts -> read wiki/index.md first, then follow the relevant section links only
- if the question is about create a linear ticket -> read wiki/index.md first, then follow the relevant section and follow the ticket structure

Always read wiki/index.md before reading any raw files.
The wiki is the compressed layer. Prefer it over raw files whenever possible.
Only go into raw/ when the wiki does not have enough detail to answer.

---

## Ingest workflow

When I add a new source to `raw/` and ask you to ingest it:

1. Read the full source document.
2. Briefly discuss key takeaways with me before writing anything (1-2 paragraphs, or a short bullet list).
3. Create a summary page in `wiki/` named after the source (or a good short name), using the page format below.
4. Create or update concept pages for each major idea, entity, company, product, or person.
5. Add wiki-links `[[page-name]]` to connect related pages.
6. Update `wiki/index.md` with new pages and one-line descriptions, grouped by type (concepts, companies, products, people, decisions, etc.).
7. Append an entry to `wiki/log.md` with:
   - date
   - source name
   - pages created/updated
   - a one-line description of what changed

A single source may touch many wiki pages. That is normal and encouraged.

Never write or edit anything inside `raw/`.

---

## Ingest tracking

After ingesting a file, append its filename to `wiki/log.md`.
When asked to ingest, always read `wiki/log.md` first and skip files already listed there.
Only process files in `raw/` that have NOT been logged yet.

---

## Roadmap workflow

The [[wiki/roadmap]] is a centralized tracker of all feature requests and work items across instacar and personal projects.

**When to add to roadmap**:
- When you add a new source to `raw/` and say "add this to the roadmap"
- The roadmap entry should capture the request, date, context, and source file

**How to add to roadmap**:
1. Add a new section in `wiki/roadmap.md` for that date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
2. Include: Project name, who requested it, source link, context tag, status, description, and next steps
3. Update `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md` to reflect the change
4. Use the template in the roadmap file for consistency

**Roadmap queries**:
- User can ask "What was requested on [date]?" and you search `wiki/roadmap.md` by date
- User can ask "Show me all [context] roadmap items" and you filter by [instacar] or [personal]
- User can ask "What's the status of [project]?" and you look up the item and report status

## Page format

Every wiki page should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Page Title

**Summary**: One to two sentences describing this page.
**Context**: [instacar] or [blog] or [personal] or [concepts]
**Sources**: List of raw source files this page draws from.
**Last updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

***

Main content goes here. Use clear headings and short paragraphs.
Link to related concepts using [[wiki-links]] throughout the text.

## Related pages
- [[related-concept-1]]
- [[related-concept-2]]
```

Additional rules:

- Use descriptive titles that match how I would search (e.g. `instacar-product-design-research`).
- Prefer one page per concept/entity rather than huge everything-pages.

---

## Contexts

I operate mainly in these contexts:

- **instacar** - my primary product role.
- **personal blog** - writing, publishing, and audience-building.
- **personal projects** - experiments, apps, side projects.
- **general knowledge / craft** - product management, strategy, psychology, etc.

When creating or updating pages:

- Tag or note which context(s) a page is most relevant to using the **Context** field in the page header.
- If a page is heavily tied to one context (e.g. instacar), make that clear in the summary.
- If a concept cuts across contexts (e.g. "activation", "retention"), keep it neutral and link to context-specific pages.

---

## Citation rules

- Every factual claim should reference its source file.
- Use the format `(source: filename.ext)` after the claim, or list multiple sources as `(source: file1.pdf, file2.md)`.
- If two sources disagree, note the contradiction explicitly and keep both positions.
- If a claim has no source, mark it as needing verification (e.g. "(needs verification)").

In wiki pages:
- Keep the **Sources** field in the header up to date.
- Inline references are fine, but do not spam them on every sentence.

---

## Question answering

When I ask a question:

1. Read `wiki/index.md` first to find relevant pages and sections.
2. Read those pages and synthesize a concise, opinionated answer.
3. Reference specific wiki pages in your response (e.g. "see [[instacar-product-strategy]] for more detail").
4. If the answer is not in the wiki, say that clearly.
5. If the answer is valuable and likely to be reused:
   - Propose a new or updated wiki page to store it.
   - Only write that page if I approve or explicitly ask you to.

Good answers should flow back into the wiki so knowledge compounds.

---

## Lint / audit workflow

When I ask you to lint or audit the wiki:

- Check for contradictions between pages about the same concept, company, or decision.
- Find orphan pages (no inbound links from other pages) and suggest where they should be linked.
- Identify concepts mentioned in pages that lack their own page and suggest a list of missing pages.
- Flag claims that may be outdated based on newer sources, especially for product decisions.
- Check that pages follow the standard page format (Summary, Context, Sources, Last updated, Related pages).
- Provide a numbered report with:
  - issue
  - suggested fix
  - files involved

If I approve, you can apply some of the fixes yourself (creating links, adding summaries, updating headers).

---

## Rules and constraints

- Never modify anything in the `raw/` folder.
- Always update `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md` after making structural changes to the wiki.
- Keep page filenames lowercase with hyphens (e.g. `instacar-onboarding-flow.md`).
- Use clear, plain language. Avoid jargon unless it's a defined concept in the wiki.
- When uncertain about how to categorize something, ask me instead of guessing.
- Prefer incremental changes over big restructurings. Propose reorganizations before doing them.
- Never use -- in your outputs.
- All instacar and instacar related products are always lowercase.

---

## How to treat my roles

When working with instacar / personal blog / personal projects content:

- **instacar** - favor depth, decisions, trade-offs, and context for product choices.
- **personal blog** - extract and store reusable frameworks and insights, not just post drafts.
- **personal projects** - store the "lessons learned" and reusable patterns, not just implementation details.

Use this knowledge when deciding what belongs in the wiki vs what can stay as a raw note or temporary idea.

---

## Linear ticket creation workflow

When you're asked to create a Linear ticket, use these defaults unless I specify otherwise:

- **Assignee**: me (the user)
- **Team**: product
- **Status**: Backlog

Override any of these only if I explicitly say "assign to [person]", "team: [team]", or "status: [status]".
